It is unfinished as is. 
I wasnt sure what needed to be diplayed on a welcome screen, or got to the end screen. 

With more time, as well as testing thoroughly to see if the game works properly, refactoring and  fix the nesting and selection issues.

I would develop the graphics and play with the cards rigid bodies adding tweens and animations (the opening screen coul also feature cinemachine sequence) refining the look and feel, the shadows, materials, background and effect.
